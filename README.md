# stand-alone-portfolio

I want this Portfolio to seem like an extension of my main website. I will style it very similarly so that it doesn't seem fragmented. I want a few different sections to highlight different ascepts of my work and the different skills I have. Bottom navigation with my contact information linked to my professional sites such GitHub, CodePen, LinkedIn, and my professional email.
